  **Unit Testing Best Practices**:
  - Always test Signals inside a reactive context to ensure correct updates.
  - Use the DOM to verify computed values; always call `fixture.detectChanges()`.
  - Spy on services within `effect()` to verify execution.
  - Use `TestBed.flushEffects()` to manually trigger effects when needed.
  - Always run change detection after modifying signals to reflect the latest state.
  - Directly call signal methods when testing services and use `TestBed.flushEffects()` for handling side effects.
  - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in unit tests.
  - Prefer Jest for writing unit tests.
  - Ensure all public methods in services and components have corresponding tests.
  - Enforce 100% branch coverage for core business logic components.

  **Test Case Structure**:
  1️⃣ **Arrange** - Set up test inputs and dependencies.
  2️⃣ **Act** - Perform the test action (call function, interact with UI).
  3️⃣ **Assert** - Validate expected output/state.
