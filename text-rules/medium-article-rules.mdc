# ✍️ Medium Article Writing Rules (Inspired by Awais Shaikh’s Angular Hydration Post)

## 🧱 Article Structure Rules

### 1. Start with a Hooking Title
- Use **wordplay** or metaphors (e.g., _“Keep Hydrated with Angular”_)
- Include the main tech/topic (e.g., _“Angular Incremental Hydration”_)
- Bonus: emojis help stand out (✅ Optional)

---

### 2. Use a Clean and Short Intro
- 2–4 lines max
- Start with a **relatable problem** or trend
- Follow with a **clear goal or question**

**Example:**  
> Angular 17 introduced a hydration strategy that’s a performance breakthrough. But how do you use it right?

---

### 3. Set Expectations with a Table of Contents
```markdown
Here’s what we’ll cover:
- What is hydration?
- How Angular handles it
- Incremental hydration flow
- Common gotchas and solutions
```

✅ Helps readers scan and stay engaged

---

### 4. Use Clear, Consistent Headings
Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subtopics:
```markdown
## What is Hydration?

### SSR vs Hydration
```

---

### 5. Break Down Concepts With a Mix of:
- ✅ Short paragraphs (2–3 lines)
- ✅ Bullet points or numbered lists
- ✅ **Bolded key terms** in-line
- ✅ *Italics to emphasize nuance*

---

### 6. Use Callouts for Tips or Alerts
Format tips and warnings like:
```markdown
**💡 Tip:** Always use `trackBy` when using `@defer` in a loop.
```
```markdown
**⚠️ Warning:** `hydrate when` won’t work unless the parent is hydrated.
```

---

### 7. Use Code Blocks Effectively
Stick to relevant, minimal examples:
```ts
@defer (hydrate on interaction) {
  <my-chart></my-chart>
}
```

---

### 8. Embed Visuals Sparingly But Meaningfully
- Use 1–2 diagrams/screenshots
- Keep visuals high-contrast and readable
- Reference them in text

---

### 9. Wrap Up With Final Thoughts + CTA
Summarize key takeaways in bullets or a short paragraph.

Close with a **reader question** or CTA like:
> Tried this in production? Let me know how it went in the comments.

---

### 10. Use Tags + SEO-friendly Slug
- Add relevant Medium tags (e.g., `Angular`, `Web Development`)
- Make the URL slug clear:  
  `/angular-incremental-hydration-guide`

---

## ✨ Optional Style Enhancers
- Use analogies
- Link to official docs, PRs, explainer videos
- Include a quote-style line:
> “Defer blocks hydrate only when triggered. But the *trigger* is everything.”
